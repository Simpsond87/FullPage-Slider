## FullPage-Slider
This project is an assignment for theClubhou.se Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp course.

A boilerplate was used for the foundation of the project for ReactJS. The boilerplate included generators for containers and components. It included features such as CSS-loading and Styled-Components. React-Icons, React-Responsive, and Material-UI are also included by default for UI/UX design.

## Description
This project is a web page with a FullPage Image Slider that loops through several images and displays them in full width of the browser window. Also, if you click the forward or back buttons, it jumps to the respective next or previous image. Hovering over the buttons will stop the slider from automatically looping, and moving the cursor away from the buttons restarts the slideshow.

## Getting Started
To quickly get started, fork this repo and clone it onto your local computer. Then run npm install to install all of the necessary libraries. Open your terminal or GitBash and use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Simpsond87/FullPage-Slider.git
cd FullPage-Slider
npm install
```

To run the server, simply do npm run start and your development website will be on http://localhost:3000.
